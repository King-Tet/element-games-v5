The fan-favorite <strong>My Hero Academia</strong> collaboration returns to Stumble Guys, bringing back heroic energy, powerful cosmetics, and your favorite characters from U.A. Highschool! Suit up as Deku, Bakugo, Todoroki, and more as you stumble your way to victory with style worthy of a Pro Hero. Whether you’re team Class 1-A or plotting like a villain, this is your chance to show what being a hero really means. For those of you who are really taking it to the <strong>Plus Ultra</strong> level, there is a shiny <strong>new Skin: All Might</strong> in his <img src=\"https://live-assets2.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_6_e6dd2afcc6.png\" alt=\"unnamed (6).png\"> Professor suit! This skin has a very dynamic feature: he transforms back and forth between his base and power form depending on how much power is put into the battle! <strong>New Cosmetic:</strong> Professor All Might [Special] Missed something the first time? Now’s your moment to complete your collection!</p><p>&nbsp;________ &nbsp;</p><p>New Level: <strong>Starship Stumble</strong> Buckle up, Stumblers! it’s time to take your stumbling interstellar. Starship Stumble throws you onto a collapsing space highway aboard a runaway spacecraft, where survival means quick thinking, low-gravity leaps, and serious pro moves. As the match begins, players speed into a debris field orbiting a dying planet. Waves of floating junk hurtle toward the ship, and it’s up to you to jump, dive, and weave your way through the chaos. Sounds easy? Think again.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you clear the early waves, gravity takes a break. The low-gravity zone lets you soar to new heights. But don’t be so chill, it also brings bigger, more dangerous obstacles. Midway through, the stakes rise as the floor drops away, forcing players to land only on obstacles to survive.&nbsp;</p><p>Every surface becomes a hazard or a lifeline. Want to really show off? This Level is packed with <strong>skill-based shortcuts</strong> and <strong>side clutch opportunities</strong> for the boldest Stumblers. Starship Stumble isn’t just about dodging danger, it’s about mastering momentum. Can you navigate the stars and make it to the end, or will you be lost in orbit? <img src=\"https://live-assets2.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_7_ae6d952004.png\" alt=\"unnamed (7).png\"> __________&nbsp;</p><p>New Level: <strong>Graffiti Gravity Legendary</strong> <strong>Graffiti Gravity is back, and this time, it’s Legendary.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Step into a chaotic art-filled arena where blocks rain from above, the floor is never safe, and survival means thinking fast and jumping faster. All your favorite hazards return: Normal blocks that demand quick dodges, drill blocks that cut through the arena, paint balloons that splatter chaos across the floor… But now, a new double-height block enters the mix, shaking up your strategy with intense jump sequences and sudden arena splits. These mega blocks divide the battlefield, forcing you to adapt on the fly or be flattened.&nbsp;</p><p>And that’s just the beginning. With larger, more unpredictable and randomized wave patterns, no two matches feel the same. Just when you think you’ve found a safe spot, the arena shrinks, leaving less room and more pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, and did we mention Team mode? Team up with a friend, revive each other mid-match, and try to outlast the chaos together. In Graffiti Gravity Legendary, expect the unexpected, and then some more. Will you survive the storm of color, or be painted out of the match? <img src=\"https://live-assets2.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_8_ec8df9d018.png\" alt=\"unnamed (8).png\"> ______&nbsp;</p><p>New Level: <strong>Night Dash</strong> You know the chaos.&nbsp;</p><p>You know the blocks. But you’ve never seen Block Dash like this! Night Dash takes the classic elimination experience and launches it into deep space. The floor? Invisible. The skybox? A swirling cosmic void. And beneath it all? A massive, ominous black hole, ready to swallow any Stumbler who slips. Don’t worry: the mechanics remain untouched.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s the same iconic gameplay you know and love: dodge the incoming blocks, time your jumps, and don’t fall. But the new look dials the tension way up, playing with your senses as you stumble across a transparent floor suspended in the stars. This is Block Dash… but in space. Welcome to the Night Dash. Try not to lose your footing, or your mind. <img src=\"https://live-assets2.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/6473f27c_cb77_4e47_8629_8da5f00dcdbf_0dbd39576d.png\" alt=\"6473f27c-cb77-4e47-8629-8da5f00dcdbf.png\"> _______&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ranked Season 13</strong> This season, it’s time to <strong>strip it back to the basics.</strong> In Ranked Season 13, we’re testing a bold twist: <strong>no Abilities, just skills.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Every dash, dive, and dodge will be powered solely by your instincts and reflexes, no special powers, no second chances. To make things even more exciting, we’ve updated the Level pool to suit each rank tier.

Better be ready to drop some amazing plays! \n\n### WHAT'S NEW IN THIS SEASON?\n\nFor Season 11 of Ranked, we’re making a key adjustment to improve matchmaking and the overall Ranked experience:\n\n- Smaller Matches, Tighter Competition - Ranked matches now feature 12 players instead of 16.\n\nThis change speeds up matchmaking, especially during off-peak hours, and creates more consistent, competitive battles. With fewer players, each match feels tighter, more strategic, and more skill-based, just as our top players have requested.\n\n- Rank Points (RP) rewards have also been rebalanced to match the new 12-player format, ensuring your climb remains fair and rewarding.\n\n- Party Size Adjustments \n\nWith the 12-player format, Play with Friends now supports up to 3 players per Ranked lobby (down from 4).\nThis helps maintain balanced matchmaking and ensures fair competition across all parties. It’s still the perfect way to climb the ranks with your duo or trio squad.\n\n- Champion Exclusive Reward \n\nThose who make it all the way to Champion Rank will unlock a brand-new exclusive skin — Champion Knight will be your badge of honor that will showcase your elite skills!\n\n### Abilities Configuration\n\nTo keep Ranked focused on skill and balance, only a select group of Abilities are enabled this season:\n\n- Briefcase\n- Shield\n- Speed Gel\n- Punch\n- Spin\n- Sticky Bomb\n- Bouncing Ball\n- Dice Roll\n\n### SEASON 11 MAP ROTATION\n\nWe’ve fine-tuned the level pools for each rank — every map in a given pool has equal chance of appearing: \n\n<u>Wood, Bronze and Silver:</u>\n\n- Factory Fiasco\n- Laser Dash\n- Block Dash\n- Jungle Roll\n- Bombardment (Wood/Bronze only)\n- sh-ARRRRGH-ks! (Silver only)\n\n<u>Gold:</u>\n\n- Factory Fiasco\n- Laser Dash\n- Block Dash\n- sh-ARRRRGH-ks!\n\n<u>Platinum:</u>\n\n- Factory Fiasco\n- Laser Dash\n- Block Dash Legendary\n- Rush Hour Legendary\n\nMaster and Champion:\n- Factory Fiasco\n- Block Dash Legendary\n- Rush Hour Legendary\n- Laser Dash Legendary\n\nWe’re aiming to keep the Ranked grind smooth, competitive, and rewarding. We’ll be keeping a close eye on how this change plays out. Thanks for climbing the ranks with us!

You haven’t seen anything yet. In this update, we’re cranking the madness up a notch with Extras, a brand-new game mode coming to events that gives everyone a set of wild powers to open your way to victory. These mechanics are designed to shake up the rules of play. And the best part? Everyone’s powered. Everyone’s dangerous.\n\nBut it’s not just the gameplay getting a glow-up. Several iconic levels are getting a sleek visual rework, with polished environments and upgraded effects that make the chaos look better than ever. Same wild fun, now with even more shine.\n\nReady to power up and stand out? Let’s stumble into a whole new dimension of fun.\n\n### Levels Polish\n\nSome iconic levels just got a serious glow-up! We’ve upgraded effects, lighting, and polish to make the chaos feel more immersive than ever. These levels have been optimized to improve their performance. Gameplay is unchanged—only visuals!\n\n**Updated levels:**\n\n- Bombardment\n- sh-ARRRRGH-ks!\n- Sharkmuda Triangle,\n- Jungle Roll\n\n### Changes to MrBeast Content:\n\nAs part of the 0.87 update, we’ve removed the Workshop MrBeast-branded content from Stumble Guys due to the expiration of our licensing agreement.\n\nThis includes de-branded assets previously used in Workshop maps. As a result, some existing Workshop creations may look and feel different than before.\n\nWe understand this may be unexpected for some players and creators, and we appreciate your understanding as we continue to evolve the game and its content.\n\n### New Feature: EXTRAS!\n\n![unnamed (9).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_9_cdb15d0e90.png)\n\n\nIntroducing **EXTRAS**, a brand-new way to experience events with a powerful twist. \n\nThis feature adds unique functionalities to your gameplay, similar to abilities, but designed to keep things fair and fun for everyone. \n\nWhether you're surviving in elimination levels, or punching your way through the chaos in race levels, EXTRAS are activated for all players in selected events, bringing a fresh layer of strategy, unpredictability, and pure Stumble madness. \n\nSome events will let you equip your own abilities, with EXTRAS adding even more tools for chaos. Others will level the playing field by disabling personal abilities entirely. Everyone will compete using the same set of features.\n\n\nIt’s not about picking the best power, it’s about making the most of what everyone’s got. Let the experiments begin!\n\nLet’s take a look at the first EXTRAS we are introducing in this version:\n\n![unnamed (10).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_10_93ad63b376.png)\n\nNeed a lift? Activate Geyser Gust to blast yourself \nhigh into the air with a burst of upward energy! \nYou’ve got 3 charges to use. Stack them to stay airborne \neven longer. Whether you’re on the ground or mid-jump, \nlaunch upward in style with a mini geyser that follows \nyour every move. Perfect for big escapes or high-flying stunts.\n\n![unnamed (13).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_13_8074c7ccb6.png)\n\nBuild your own path! Walk the Plank lets you drop \nplatforms beneath your feet, on the ground or in \nmid-air, giving you new ways to cross gaps, reach \nshortcuts, or help your squad. Each player gets \n2 charges, and anyone can use the planks you place. \nLink them together for epic tricks, sneaky detours, \nor pure platforming chaos.\n\n![unnamed (12).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_12_547702d8d3.png)\n\nRelease the Crab Attack! Lob a cranky crustacean into \nthe fray and watch it scuttle side to side, \nknocking back anyone in its path, friends and foes alike. \t\nThe crab walks until it hits a wall or a player, \nthen flips direction and keeps going. \nPunch it, kick it, dodge it... just don’t get crab-smacked!\n\n![unnamed (11).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_11_660d642b70.png)\n\nLike it or not, It’s party time! Drop a Dance Fever zone around \nyou that forces nearby opponents into a groovy \ndance break. While the music plays, anyone caught \nin the area slows down and loses access to their \nown abilities. Keep moving and the disco follows you.\njust beware, your dance floor might get crowded fast!\n\n### Abilities Balance Changes\n\nAs part of this update, we’ve made a few balance tweaks to existing abilities to keep the action fair, fun, and unpredictable. \n\n- Invisibility: Duration at max level slightly increased to help you stay sneaky a bit longer.\n- Shield: Buffed slightly to match the improved invisibility timing.\n- Briefcase Silence: Effectiveness slightly reduced, so it’s no longer stronger than Shutdown.\n- Dice Roll: Slightly increased cooldown and a small reduction to max speed. It is still wild, just a bit more manageable.\n- Banana: Tweaked cooldown and stun time at max to better balance its impact.\n\n### Cosmetics\n\n<u>Taunt Animations</u>\n\n- Parrot [Legendary]\n- Swashbuckling [Epic]\n- Telescope [Rare]\n\n<u>Victory Animations</u>\n\n- Crab Dance [Uncommon]\n- Forbidden Treasure [Legendary]\n- Mount the Cannons [Epic]\n- Swab the Deck [Rare]\n- Trident [Rare]\n\n### Bug fixes\n\nWe’ve been hard at work squashing bugs and improving your experience in Stumble Guys!

As it falls, it shatters on impact, creating an area of effect . Anyone caught inside this area (including the thrower) is temporarily transformed into a chicken, complete with increased movement speed and reduced jump height.\n\n## SEASON MAP ROTATION\n\n<u>Wood and  Bronze:</u>\n\n- Graffiti Gravity\n- Laser Dash\n- Rush Hour\n- Block Dash Remastered\n\n<u>Silver:</u>\n\n- Graffiti Gravity\n- Laser Dash\n- Rush Hour\n- Block Dash Remastered\n- Bot Bash\n\n<u>Gold:</u>\n\n- Graffiti Gravity\n- Laser Dash\n- Rush Hour\n- Bot Bash\n- Block Dash Legendary\n\n<u>Platinum:</u>\n\n- Graffiti Gravity\n- Laser Dash\n- Bot Bash\n- Block Dash Legendary\n- Laser Tracer\n- Rush Hour Legendary\n\n<u>Master and  Champion:</u>\n\n- Graffiti Gravity\n- Block Dash Legendary\n- Laser Tracer\n- Rush Hour Legendary\n- Laser Dash Legendary\n\nRanked season 10 ends on Thursday, 5 June.

Dash through high-tech slides and sizzling lasers in a brand-new race level, or test your reflexes in the latest Legendary Laser Tracer gauntlet. Plus, it’s survival of the silliest in the all-new Stumblewood battle royale. \n\nAnd to top it all off, we’re giving the game a fresh coat of paint. The Shop has been updated, and the main menu has been upgraded, putting everything right at your fingertips. Sleek, sharp, and ready for action - just like you. Let’s stumble into this new era, hero or villain cape in tow!\n\n## NEW LEVELS\n\n**Laser Slide**\n\n- Slide & Sprint Fusion: This level combines fast-paced slide segments with on-foot laser sections, delivering nonstop action from start to finish.\n- Multiple Routes & Pro-moves: Discover alternate paths and skips.\n- Randomized Laser Layouts: No two races are the same—laser sections change every round to keep things fresh.\n\n**Stumblewood Arena**\n\n- No teams. No script. Just chaos.\n- Free For All Combat: No teams. Every stumbler is a target.\n- Storm Mechanic: A dangerous storm slowly closes in, shrinking the safe zone and forcing stumblers into intense final showdowns.\n- No Weapon Wheel: Weapons are picked up directly in the world, so explore and adapt fast.\n\n**Laser Tracer Legendary**\n\nMore lasers. Less mercy. The iconic Laser Tracer is back, and the lasers have been cranked up over 9000! \n\n- Laser Walls: Massive green laser walls sweep across the map with only one gap to squeeze through. Miss it? You're out.\n- Laser Pulse Rings: Laser rings drop from above, activate in bursts, and expand outward from the center.\n\n![unnamed.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_20841ff189.png)\n![unnamed (1).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_1_1f720d2fdb.png)\n\n## NEW TEAM MAPS\n- Block Dash Legendary\n- Laser Dash\n- Laser Dash Legendary\n- Rush Hour Legendary \n\n## MENU UPGRADE\n\n![unnamed (2).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_2_fa00e6b4ac.png)\n\nButtons now pop with more vibrant animations, and the entire interface has been updated with a cleaner, more modern design. \n\nWhether you’re a longtime player or just joining the stumble, we hope this fresh coat of paint makes your journey through the menus feel as fun and playful as the rest of the game.\n\n## SHOP UPDATES\n\nNew Shop User Interface\nWe’re excited to unveil a major redesign to the in-game Shop, a change that’s not just visual, but functional too.\nFirst, we’re moving away from side scrolling and introducing a new vertical scroll layout. This change makes the Shop easier to navigate and more intuitive to explore. You can now scroll up and down to view all available content in a streamlined format.\n\n![unnamed (3).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_3_c46efd9f24.png)\n\nWe’re also introducing section selectors (you’ll see these as quick-access buttons on the left side of the screen), which allow you to instantly jump through sections. \n\nBut the most exciting change? We’ve completely revamped how cosmetics are displayed. You’ll now be able to view skins in full 3D, admire their details, and get a better sense of what you’re unlocking. \n\nOn supported devices, you can toggle between the new 3D previews and the original 2D icon displays in your settings. For lower-end devices, 2D will be shown by default to ensure smooth performance—though you can switch to 3D if your device can handle it. We've optimized the experience across platforms to give everyone the best balance between performance and visual clarity.\n\n![unnamed (4).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_4_3aa6d44037.png)\n\n<u>New Shop Features</u>\n\n- Multiple Box Purchase: just like with Wheel Offers, you can now buy up to 10 reward boxes at once. The total price will adjust automatically depending on how many you choose to open.\n\n- Complete with Gems Option: if you're short on a specific currency (like event tokens), you’ll now be able to cover the difference using gems in some cases.\n\n\n## NEW RANKED FEATURE\n\n**Limited Abilities Ranked Seasons**\n\nStarting with Ranked Season 10, and based on a popular request from our community, we’re shaking up the Ranked experience with the introduction of season-specific ability pools.\nThis change is designed to add variety to the meta, encourage new strategies, and deliver a more balanced playing field.\n\nIn-game, you’ll see this reflected on the Ranked page: any disabled abilities will appear grayed out and marked with a red “X” in the ability selection menu, so you’ll always know what’s available before you queue up.\n\n\n![unnamed (5).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_5_0e3a28d5d8.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n**Featured Abilities for Ranked Season 10**\n\n- Hug\n- Banana\n- Invisibility\n- Slide\n- Punch\n- Slap\n- Power Jump\n- Chicken Bomb (NEW ABILITY)\n\n## NEW ABILITY\n\n**Chicken Bomb**\n\nIntroducing the Chicken Bomb, the unique social ability which lets players turn opponents into chickens for a limited time, creating the perfect storm of confusion, speed boosts, and LOL moments.\n\nHow it works:\nWhen activated, your Stumbler throws a flask directly into the air. As it falls, it shatters on impact, creating an area of effect . Anyone caught inside this area (including the thrower) is temporarily transformed into a chicken, complete with increased movement speed and reduced jump height.\n![unnamed (6).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_6_c3a01804bb.png)\n\n## SCHEDULED ROLLOUT & TESTING PERIOD\n\nWe’re rolling out our shiny new Shop and Main Menu interface in phases to gather feedback and keep things running smoothly. Here’s what to expect:\n\nPhase 1: May 1–6\n\nYou’ll be randomly placed into one of four groups:\n\n\n???? Old Shop & ???? Old Main Menu\n\n\n???? Old Shop & ???? New Main Menu\n\n\n???? New Shop & ???? Old Main Menu\n\n\n???? New Shop & ???? New Main Menu\n\n\nPhase 2: May 6 onward\n\nWe’ll gradually roll the new UIs out to everyone\n\n\nHow long?\n\nFrom May 1st until everyone has the new shop and interface, depending on how testing goes. \n\n\nIf things look different when you log in, that’s by design!

Whether you’re outclassing opponents in Block Dash or just vibing in the lobby, this combo shows you mean business.\n\nSo… ready to dominate the arena? Gear up, flex those reflexes, and prove you’ve got what it takes to go the distance!\n\n### What is the Sahrul Rajuan Skin, and Sahrul Rajuan Choice Event About?\n\n**Q: Tell us more about your skin!**\n\nA: The skin I created represents a pro player, as most pro players in the past used skins that are closely associated with the punch ability! This skin is inspired by boxer skins, which have many variations such as Boxer Floyd, Boxer Amin, and others. Most pro players love this skin. Since I enjoy playing competitively on the Block Dash map, I decided to create this skin.\n\n**Q: Tell us more about your event!**\n\nA: The event I created is a special event for all Block Dash fans across all variants. I have set up three matches in one competition, featuring the following maps:\n- Block Dash Remastered\n- Block Dash Legendary\n- Block Dash Classic\n\nAll these maps are available in my event\n\n**Q: Describe your reaction when you first saw yourself featured in the game.**\n\nA: I was very surprised, even for a moment I couldn't believe that I could be featured in the game. This is the biggest achievement in my life, where I can be featured in a game as big as Stumble Guys.\n\n### Tell us More About Sahrul’s Fans!\n\n**Q: How has your community supported you throughout your journey as a creator?**\n\nA: They have fully supported me.

When there is one or two different players from before, the gameplay will also be different from the previous match.\n\n**Q: Do you have a secret tip or trick that helps you win more games?**\n\nA: A special tip is to play often and learn from mistakes. If you can improve your skills, you will become much better than before.\n\n**Q: If you could design a new map for Stumble Guys, what would it be like?**\n\nA: Maybe I will create a very large Block Dash map, possibly accommodating 64 players in a single match! That would be an incredible experience.\n\n### Content Creation & Future Plans\n\n**Q: What’s been the biggest challenge in creating content for Stumble Guys, and how do you overcome it?**\n\nA: The biggest challenge in creating content for Stumble Guys has been staying consistent while keeping my ideas fresh and engaging. Sometimes, it’s hard to come up with new concepts that excite both me and my audience. I overcome this by constantly analyzing trends, listening to feedback from my community, and challenging myself to improve my gameplay and editing skills.\n\n**Q: If you had unlimited resources, what would your dream Stumble Guys content project be?**\n\nA: I will create more competitive matches by forming clans or guilds. This would greatly help the community grow and stay active. With the support of clans or guilds, the competitive scene in the game can improve, offering exciting gameplay for the community. This way, it will revive and rebuild the long-lost community.\n\n**Q: Do you have any big surprises or upcoming projects that you can tease for your fans?**\n\nA: Maybe that's still a secret. Just wait and see! :D\n\n### Let’s Get to Know More About Sahrul!\n\n**Q: If you could have any superpower while playing Stumble Guys, what would it be?**\n\nA: Of course, the super punch ability!

Obstacles may have different signalling signs, so keep your eyes peeled \n\n- The Big Blocks will cause the floor to break away from under them after the floor can't handle the weight anymore. You definitely don't want one of these to land on you either!\n\n- The Drill Blocks - as the name suggests - will drill through the floor and slowly descend. Again, much like the big block, you definitely don't want one of these to land on you either.\n\n- Finally... Paint Balloons? These giant balloons filled with paint pack a punch and will send any stumbler too close into the air, but if they hit the floor, you can expect them to destroy the floor instantly.\n\nUse the blocks to your advantage, and survive for as long as you can!

This high-speed industrial nightmare throws you onto a massive, out-of-control conveyor belt, sending you hurdling through a gauntlet of unpredictable hazards.\n\nIt is a non-stop scramble to dodge obstacles, leap over gaps, and avoid getting tossed into the abyss. But don’t get too comfortable—the terrain itself isn’t playing fair! Sections of the conveyor will suddenly drop, forcing you to make split-second decisions. Will you land on another belt, or will you use scattered crates as floating islands to stay in the game?\n\nAs the challenge ramps up, expect trickier obstacle combinations, and even fewer safe spaces to land. If you want to survive, you’ll need quick reflexes, clever movement, and a sharp eye for skill-based shortcuts.\n\nThink you can handle the madness? There’s only one way to find out—step onto the belt and brace for impact!\n\n## LEVEL REMOVALS\n\nAs part of our ongoing updates, some levels will be phased out this March to make way for new content and experiences.

And if I ever run out of new things to cover, I usually will do challenge videos like trying to get a special from the lucky wheel, or seeing how many skins I can get on a brand new account!\n\n- **Could you describe one or two of your favorite pieces of content that you’ve made for Stumble Guys and what made them special?**\nMy favorite short I ever made was probably the short where I ask viewers to pick a stumble guys card from my hand, and then the character on that card is opened in a wheel. I loved all the comments wondering how I knew what card they picked! My favorite long form video I ever made was probably when I reacted to getting the Free Spirit skin for the very first time! I thought it was hilarious and it became a meme on my channel for a long time.\n\n- **What are your future plans regarding content creation for Stumble Guys? Are there any new directions or concepts you’re excited to explore?**\nI’m very excited about the addition of a ranked mode and new abilities in the 0.75 update! I think that will inspire many new content ideas for creators like myself!\n\n- **What advice would you give to someone who wants to start creating content for Stumble Guys?**\nBe consistent, and figure out what type of content you like to create the most. Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see success right away! Just have fun with it, and good things will come!\n\n- **Where is the bundle available and for how long?**\nIn the Stumble Guys item shop from February 6th to the 27th!\n\n- **The link to your main channel?** [**<u>LINK</u>**](https://www.youtube.com/corallll)\n\n- **What is your creator code?**\nCORAL\n\nAnd there you have it, Stumblers - straight from the legend himself!

We’ve been actively listening to the community, analyzing your suggestions, and making adjustments to ensure a fair and engaging experience for everyone. ","content":"## Ability Balance Changes\n\nIn this update, we’ve focused on refining the gameplay experience by implementing specific balance changes based on your invaluable feedback. We’ve been actively listening to the community, analyzing your suggestions, and making adjustments to ensure a fair and engaging experience for everyone. \n\nThese changes aim to enhance both competitiveness and fun. We invite you to dive into the details and see how your input has helped shape the game’s evolution!\n\n#### Global Changes\n\nIncrease global cooldown from 3 to 5 seconds. This will help slow down the rate at which abilities can be chained together.\n\nAs part of this change we have also extended the period at the start of a round before you can use an ability which means you should no longer be immediately hit with an ability before you can move.\n\n\n#### Hug\n\nFor levels 3+ the scaling of the Speed stat is reduced exponentially.\n\nHug is an ability that allows players to grab another. It is designed to give players an edge when playing in small areas to try and get them eliminated. Whilst it is excelling in doing so, it was also allowing players to go faster than intended. We are nerfing the upgraded versions to avoid making it used for self mobility.\n\n#### Slide (Kick)\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly. The slippery stat effect is reduced significantly.\n\nKick is one of the classic abilities in Stumble Guys. It has always been one of the most used abilities due to its ability to both attack and move around the maps especially in block dash where it allows players to break some of the lower blocks. However it was performing too well and we want it to be more balanced. In order to do so we are increasing its cooldown overall so players need to use it more carefully and not rely on being able to use it so often. In addition we are tuning down the side effect it had when it reached level 15 by decreasing the amount of time it leaves players stunned by the kick being slippery.\n\n#### Dice Roll\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly and the duration is reduced 50%. For levels 3+ the speed is reduced exponentially.\n\nDice is a throwable ability that behaves differently from the others as it is shot in a straight line. We are tuning down most of its values to remove how effective it is at removing rivals in small maps such as blockdash and bot bash. We are increasing the cooldown of it, whilst also decreasing how long the dice remains in the map after being thrown and decreasing the force it is thrown at. These changes should keep Dice a powerful ability whilst not as powerful as it was and also reduce the frequency it could be used beforehand.\n\n#### Bolt\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly and the force is reduced significantly.\n\nBolt is an interesting throwable ability because it is one of the few that takes away mobility whilst casting. We are happy with how the magnetism was behaving as an effect but due to its strong force it was doing too much as an attack option. Therefore we are reducing the force to try and make it more situational for certain maps and increasing its cooldown.\n\n\n#### Invisibility\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly and the duration is reduced 50%.\n\nWith the increase of ability usage in the game, invisibility has been a preferred solution to avoid being attacked however this defensive ability was allowing for some unavoidable attacks making it an absolute threat. Therefore we are increasing the cooldown of the ability whilst also reducing the duration of the invisible state to ensure players will not be able to attack whilst invisible. We are making this change to make sure invisibility still remains a good defensive and mobile ability but remove its offense combination.\n\n#### Shield\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly. For levels 2+ the duration is reduced slightly.\n\nSimilar to Invisibility, the shield is a very good defensive ability. However due to its cooldown and duration it was constantly in use for players that had it maxed and could quickly combine being shielded with an attack. Therefore we are also increasing the cooldown of the ability and reducing its duration so players need to time better their shield and not use it on cooldown.\n\n#### Rake\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly and duration is reduced 35%. The confusion stat is reduced significantly.\n\nRake is a one of a kind throwable that allows players to throw it behind themselves and place it in strategic positions. However it was performing a bit too well due to its duration until it disappeared and the confusion side effect that was unlocked at level 15. We have increased the cooldown to make it in line with other throwables whilst also reducing the duration of the rake in gameplay and reduced the time players were affected by the confusion effect.\n\n#### Chop\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly. The Force stat is no longer upgradeable. Instead you can now upgrade the new Squish stat.\n\nChop is a unique ability that at max level is able to squish opponents. However it was only performing differently to other abilities at max level and in doing the other effects it was worse than the rest. Therefore, we decided to use the uniqueness of the squish and make it one of the upgradable stats. We believe this ability will be more powerful than before so we are increasing the cooldown to balance its usage. From now on we will keep a close eye to see how the ability behaves but with the aim of making the unique condition of squishing opponents and reducing their jump ability one of the choices for owners to include in their ability repertoire and playstyle.\n\n\n#### Slap\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly. The Angle is no longer upgradeable. Instead it is fixed at the max 90 degrees for all levels. It is replaced with the new Force stat which is upgradable.\n\nSlap is an ability that was designed as the alternative to punch. The design idea behind slap is that it is weaker in terms of force compared to punch but it is easier to hit and can do so in a larger area. However, because of the small force it wasn't as impactful as we hoped, therefore we are making the uniqueness of its wide area a permanent aspect of the ability and changing the stat upgrade into the Force instead of Angle.\n\n#### Punch\n\nWe reduced the angle of impact to make it hit in a straight line. For all levels except Max level the cooldown has been reduced slightly. \n\nPunch is a powerful ability. With its strong force it is able to eliminate players in most elimination maps and whilst we want punch to be powerful we don't want it to be dominant. Therefore, we are making it harder to hit, reducing the area it’s able to impact. This should make it harder for players to aim if the rival is moving around while making it easier to avoid getting punched yourself.\n\n#### Bouncing Ball\n\nFor all levels the duration is reduced significantly. For levels 4+ the speed is reduced slightly. For max level the knockback is reduced slightly.\n\nVolleyball is the king of movement abilities and whilst that meets the design intentions, it was doing it too well. Therefore we are reducing the max speed and also reducing the total duration of the transformation. This should still allow players to use it in certain occasions but not using it several times in one transformation therefore reducing its impact in game. We have also removed the ability that volleyball had at max level of pushing rivals to make sure that volleyball only performs well in its mobility characteristics and not used as an attack option. This change also aims to make it easier to block players using volleyball from getting in front of them.\n\n#### Snowball\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly. The duplication stat is replaced with a new upgradeable slow stat.\n\nSimilarly to the Sticky Bomb , Snowball is a movement penalty throwable that wasn't quite able to have an impact on gameplay. We have changed the variable of being able to have a greater chance of throwing multiple snowballs into how strong the slow is once the snowball is landed successfully. The duration of being slowed is intended to be longer since it's a harder to hit ability than the sticky bomb.\n\n#### Sticky Bomb\n\nFor all levels the cooldown is reduced slightly. The duration stat is no longer upgradable, instead it is a static 2. It is replaced with a new upgradable slow stat. The \n\nSticky bomb is a zone control throwable that wasn't quite capable of competing with other abilities due to its stats. We have changed the duration of the slow into how powerful that slow is, we aim to make the movement penalty this ability main characteristic transforming it into a more viable option for players. The intention of this ability is to be an alternative to snowball making it have a shorter duration of slow but being able to affect a larger area.\n\n#### Spin\n\nSword spin is similar to the Bolt ability in that it requires the casting player to remain in position. Whilst it takes a longer time and it might be riskier to use in certain occasions its power and area of reach compensate for it. However we found that the ability wasn't performing properly due to an issue where it wouldn´t hit in a 360 angle, we have fixed that issue to make sure it is still a viable option for players","slug":"ability-balance-changes-","createdAt":"2025-01-30T10:52:31.428Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-30T10:52:32.736Z","publishedAt":"2025-01-30T10:52:32.729Z","locale":"en","embedded_url":null,"main_image":{"data":{"id":1184,"attributes":{"name":"STG-45113_Ability Week In-App Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":800,"height":450,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/small_STG_45113_Ability_Week_In_App_Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h_3d5c445872.png","hash":"small_STG_45113_Ability_Week_In_App_Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h_3d5c445872","mime":"image/png","name":"small_STG-45113_Ability Week In-App Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h.png","path":null,"size":353.06,"width":500,"height":281},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/medium_STG_45113_Ability_Week_In_App_Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h_3d5c445872.png","hash":"medium_STG_45113_Ability_Week_In_App_Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h_3d5c445872","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_STG-45113_Ability Week In-App Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h.png","path":null,"size":759.93,"width":750,"height":422},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/thumbnail_STG_45113_Ability_Week_In_App_Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h_3d5c445872.png","hash":"thumbnail_STG_45113_Ability_Week_In_App_Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h_3d5c445872","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_STG-45113_Ability Week In-App Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h.png","path":null,"size":90.81,"width":245,"height":138}},"hash":"STG_45113_Ability_Week_In_App_Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h_3d5c445872","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":142.45,"url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/STG_45113_Ability_Week_In_App_Event_800x450_viw6clqe0h_3d5c445872.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2025-01-30T10:51:42.808Z","updatedAt":"2025-01-30T10:51:42.808Z"}}},"likes":{"data":{"id":7,"attributes":{"count":1396,"createdAt":"2025-02-28T17:15:11.919Z","updatedAt":"2025-08-18T22:30:43.815Z"}}},"localizations":{"data":[]}}},{"id":268,"attributes":{"title":"0.83 Patch Notes - Bringing The Heat!","overview":"Hi Stumblers!

A message will appear notifying the player that the user cannot be found and prompting them to create an account in the game.\n\n\n\nb) If the user exists but is not connected to the Scopely ID, an animated popup will appear, guiding the player on how to link their account to the Scopely ID within the game. Once the user closes the popup, a message informs them that their username has been found but they need to link their game to proceed.\n\n\n\nc) User connected to the Scopely ID in game\n\n\n<u>STEP 2</u>\n\nLogin with your Scopely ID account (Ensure that you are connected on the page with the same Scopely account that you use in game!)\n\n\n\n<u>STEP 3</u>\n\nLogin with twitch\n\n\n\n**1.

In version 0.80, you’ll tackle three awesome new battlegrounds:\n\n- Skyslide: A wild, gravity-defying race through the clouds!\n- Legendary Lava Land: Dodge fiery obstacles and rising lava in this prehistoric challenge.\n- Block Dash Rush Teams: Work with your squad in a turbo-charged version of Block Dash that’s all about teamwork and strategy.\n\nIt’s time to team up, race solo, and stumble your way to victory like never before! Are you ready to join the action?\n\n<u>New Level</u>\n\n**Lava Land Legendary**\n\nLegendary Lava Land reimagines the classic with a prehistoric twist, transforming the fiery\ncaldera into a tactical playground for Stumblers. Set amidst the smoking vents and ancient\ndinosaur bones of an active volcano, Legendary Lava Land amps up the original challenge\nwith dynamic new pillars and hazards that will keep even the most seasoned players on their\ntoes. Navigate around, bounce off, and avoid the new pillars, all while the molten lava rises\naround you. Get ready to test your survival skills in this intensified arena!\n\nThis level introduces a variety of new hazard pillars that shake up gameplay and add fresh\nstrategies to this fiery challenge:\n- Trampoline Pillars let you escape the lava with a bounce.\n- Flipper Pillars can toss you in unpredictable directions, demanding careful footing.\n- Rotating and Stumbling Vine Pillars add disorienting spins and tripping vines,\nrequiring precise landings.\n- Tornado and Ice Pillars throw in swirling winds and slippery surfaces, pushing your\nbalance to the limit.\n- Sticky and Crumbling Pillars create tricky situations, slowing movement and\ncollapsing underfoot.\n\n<u>Skyslide</u>\n\nSkyslide takes you to a breathtaking floating city where gravity is just another obstacle to\novercome. This unique slide race combines thrilling vertical free-falls with high-speed slide\nsections, all set against a stunning steampunk backdrop. Navigate dizzying heights, use your\nwits, and master new abilities as you race to victory!\n\nKey Gameplay Mechanics\n\n- Free Fall Mechanic: Drop through enormous vertical tubes, steering through hazards\nwith mid-air directional controls. The shifted vertical camera intensifies the sensation\nof speed and height, creating an unforgettable descent.\n- Dive Ability: Use this new move to speed up your fall, smash through breakable walls,\nand even knock rivals off course. Use it carefully to avoid obstacles or to find strategic\nshortcuts!\n\n<u>New Gameplay Feature</u>\n\n**Block Dash Rush Teams**\n\nThe high-speed thrill of Block Dash Rush just got a major upgrade with Team Mode! Race\nacross this neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape alongside your teammates as you dodge moving\nblocks, breakable platforms, and deadly lasers. Block Dash Rush Teams brings a fresh twist to\nthe chaos—your team’s fate now rests on your collective performance, not just individual\nspeed.\n\nBy now we are sure you are familiar with Team mode on race levels, but just in case you\nmissed it, here is how it works:\n- No Respawning Orbs: In team-based races, players don’t respawn, making every jump\nand dodge critical.\n- Point-Based System: Every finished position earns points for your team. The faster your\nteam members complete the race, the higher your team's overall score.\n- Qualification Rules: To move to the next round, your team needs to rank in the top half\nbased on points. As players finish, points are added to your team's total, which can\nalter standings in real-time.\n- Dynamic Round Ending: Once enough teams have qualified and it’s no longer possible\nfor others to catch up, the round ends automatically.\n\n\n<u>New Feature</u>\n\n**Ability Showcase**\n\nWe’re excited to launch a brand-new feature called Ability Showcase, designed to help you\ntest out exciting abilities even if you haven’t unlocked them yet!

Here is how it works:\n\n- A maximum of two (2) respawn orbs will appear on the map.\n- Each respawn orb appears in a random place of the map\n- Each respawn happens in a random amount of time after the last one was collected with a maximum of 12 seconds.\n- Collecting orbs will bring back players in the same order they have been eliminated, so they always come back in the same order they were eliminated (first out - first in)\n- You can collect orbs even if all your teammates are alive in order to make it more difficult for your rival teams to survive.\n\n**Race Levels**\n\nFor RACE LEVELS, there are no respawning orbs. Instead, your team’s qualification is determined by your collective team position in the race. The quicker your team finishes, the better your chances of advancing to the next round!\n\n- **Points System:** Every position in the game earns your team points.\n- **How to Qualify:** Your team needs to collect enough points to be in the top half. To move on to the next round, your team must be better than at least half of the teams competing.\n- **Leaderboard Changes:** As players finish, points are added to teams' totals, which can change your team's rank in real-time. \n- **End of Round:** The game round ends when there aren’t enough points left for any team below the cutoff to catch up. This means once it’s impossible for other teams to qualify, the round automatically stops.\n\n___________\n\n**New Gameplay Feature**\n\n<u>Endless Mode </u>\n\nYou asked for it, and we delivered! Welcome to the thrilling world of **Endless Mode Laser Tracer AND Rush Hour!** These revamped levels introduce a unique endless mechanic, meaning the challenge continues as long as players remain alive. Here's what you can expect from this exciting update:\n\n- **Endless Survival:** The level doesn't stop until the last player is eliminated. Test your endurance and see how long you can outlast your opponents in this never-ending laser dodging frenzy.\n- **Dynamic Skybox:** Experience the passage of time with a new dynamic skybox that changes as you play. Watch the sky evolve from dawn to dusk, adding a visually immersive element to your endless run.\n- **Remodeled Map:** Both levels have been meticulously remodeled for a smoother and more enjoyable experience. Navigate the arena with improved aesthetics and fluidity.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 16.19.48.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_16_19_48_b452563259.png)\n\n____________\n\n**New Feature**\n\n<u>Play Center</u>\n\nWith this update we’re introducing Play Center, a new hub that brings together different game experiences offered in Stumble Guys.

This update brings a wide variety of fresh options, including dazzling skins, vibrant footsteps, and powerful new special emotes. Whether you're looking to stand out or add an extra edge to your moves, there's something for every Stumbler in this exciting lineup.\n\n**New Special Emote:**\n\n<u>D20 Roll [SPECIAL]</u>\n- Are you feeling lucky?  Roll for initiative! Take your lucky D20 for a spin with an all new emote, roll the dice and see what number appears! Bowl down your opponents as you try your luck. Will it be unlucky number 1? Or will you get a critical roll with a 20!\n\n<u>Power Jump [SPECIAL]</u>\n- Do you have trouble making that one jump?  Need a last minute boost when jumping? Say no more! This new Special Emote is for you!  \n- With the power jump you will be able to jump higher and further by performing a boosted jump.\n- The Power Jump enables you to reach greater heights than a standard jump allows.\n- You can bridge wide gaps by either executing a regular jump followed by a Power Jump or vice versa. The choice is yours based on the situation.\n- Unlike standard jumps that can propel you forward, the Power Jump solely increases your vertical height. So, if you execute only a Power Jump, your character will ascend without moving horizontally.\n- If you've already gained horizontal velocity from a standard jump, the Power Jump will amplify your vertical leap without altering your horizontal movement.\n- If you initiate with a Power Jump followed by a standard jump, you'll gain additional height. However, you can still introduce horizontal velocity when executing the standard jump.\n\n- 66 NEW EMOTES including Common, Uncommon and Legendary rarities!\n- 63 NEW FOOTSTEPS from all rarities!\n- 46 NEW TAUNT ANIMATION (Rare, Epic and Legendary)\n- 50 NEW VICTORY ANIMATIONS from all rarities!\n- 240 NEW STUMBLERS, including:\n-- 2 Common + 8 Uncommon\n-- 29 Rare\n-- 62 Epic\n-- 66

Battle Dash Teams is here to bring a whole new level of intensity and strategy to the beloved Block Dash formula! Dive into this unique team-based mode where two teams of four face off, balancing survival and all-out attack. With powerful pickups, wild attacks, and ever-increasing chaos, only the most strategic team will prevail!\n\n**How It Works: Survive, Attack, and Outsmart**\n\nIn Battle Dash Teams, two teams of four players are placed on separate fields. Each team must not only dodge waves of incoming blocks but also collect Sword Block Pickups that charge their attack bar. Once it’s fully charged, get ready to unleash a storm of attacks on your opponents, breaking up their strategy and giving your team the advantage!\n\n**Two Types of Pickups: Silver and Gold**\n\nKeep an eye out for both Silver and Gold Sword Blocks—each contributes different points toward filling your attack bar. Collecting the right combination of these blocks will ensure your attack bar fills up faster, allowing your team to release havoc-inducing moves on the opposition.\n\n**The Heat Builds: Progressively Challenging Waves**\n\nDon’t let your guard down! The game starts off manageable, but as it progresses, block waves become increasingly difficult to dodge, with faster patterns and trickier angles. By the time the final waves roll in, it’s a full-blown test of endurance and teamwork, demanding the best from every player.\n\n**Six Game-Changing Attacks**\n\nBuild up your attack bar to unleash one of six randomized attacks on your opponents. Each attack is designed to disrupt the opposing team’s survival tactics, offering your side a tactical edge:\n- Banana Rain: Bananas fall from the sky, creating random chaos as players slip and stumble on the rival's platform.\n- Twister: A tornado zigzags across the enemy platform, bouncing players into the air—use it to disrupt their movement or even give yourself a tactical advantage.\n- Explosive Robo-Chickens: Does this need an explanation? A cannon appears on the enemy’s side, launching explosive Robo-Chickens that detonate after a short time, pushing players around the field.\n- Stellar Wind: A strong wind gust sweeps players to the right, forcing them to fight against the current while dodging blocks.\n- Laser Ring: A massive ring of static lasers moves from front to back—touch a laser, and you're instantly sent into spectator mode!\n- Tracer Beam: A laser beam chases the closest player, stunning them if they get caught in its path.\n\n**Strategy and Teamwork Are Key**\n\nBattle Dash Teams is more than just a survival game—it's a test of strategy and teamwork. With coordinated efforts, clever use of pickups, and timely attacks, you can disrupt your opponents and outlast the chaos.\n\nAre you ready to dive in and lead your team to victory?

Whether you're a solo player looking to master the obstacles or part of a team fighting for survival, this update is sure to keep you on your toes.\n\n**NEW LEVELS **\n<u> Block Dash Remastered</u>\n\nBlock Dash has had an exciting upgrade! This remastered version not only gives the level a fresh new look but also introduces new wave patterns designed to challenge both newcomers and seasoned players alike.\n\n- Fresh Visuals: Dash through a visually enhanced course with stunning new graphics, vibrant colors, and smoother animations that bring the world of Block Dash to life like never before.\n- New Wave Patterns: Prepare for 10 all-new wave formations, each designed to test your agility, timing, and adaptability. These waves range from simple block sequences to complex, high-speed patterns that require precision and quick thinking.\n- Varied Difficulty: With waves of increasing difficulty, this remastered version keeps players on their toes as the challenge ramps up round by round.

Will you become the master or the remaster? \n\nNote: The classic Block Dash level will remain in the game as well for you to enjoy the classic version whenever you want.\n\n<u>Battle Dash Teams</u>\n\nGet ready for an epic showdown in Battle Dash Teams, a brand-new team-based experience that brings a competitive twist to the classic Block Dash formula. In this unique mode, 8 players are divided into two teams, battling on separate fields to outlast both block dash waves and rival team attacks!\n\nSurvive and Attack: Use your skills to dodge waves of blocks while collecting Sword Block Pickups to charge your team’s attack bar. Once charged, unleash powerful attacks against the opposing team to disrupt their survival strategy!\n\nTwo Types of Pickups: Keep an eye out for Silver and Gold Sword Blocks—each with different point values— to quickly fill your attack bar and launch devastating effects on your rivals.\n\nThe intensity ramps up as the game progresses, starting with easier waves and gradually introducing more complex patterns and attack combinations. This one-round mode is designed to challenge even the most experienced players!\n\n**Six Powerful Attacks**: Collect enough pickups, and your team can unleash one of six randomized attacks to wreak havoc on the opposing field:\n- Banana Rain: Bananas fall from the sky, creating random chaos as players slip and stumble on the rival's platform.\n- Twister: A tornado zigzags across the enemy platform, bouncing players into the air—use it to disrupt their movement or even give yourself a tactical advantage.\n- Explosive Robo-Chickens: Does this need an explanation? A cannon appears on the enemy’s side, launching explosive Robo-Chickens that detonate after a short time, pushing players around the field.\n- Stellar Wind: A strong wind gust sweeps players to the right, forcing them to fight against the current while dodging blocks.\n- Laser Ring: A massive ring of static lasers moves from front to back—touch a laser, and you're instantly sent into spectator mode!\n- Tracer Beam: A laser beam chases the closest player, stunning them if they get caught in its path.\n\nBattle Dash Teams is not just about surviving—it's about outsmarting your opponents with teamwork, strategy, and the clever use of attacks. Will your team come out on top? Jump in and find out!\n\n**STUMBLE PASS **\n<u>Bonus Page</u>\n\nOnce all the standard rewards are claimed, players will unlock an extra bonus page where they can continue spending Stumble Pass Tokens on high-value rewards. This page remains locked until all prior rewards are collected, adding an extra layer of excitement for completionists.\n\n Important Note! Not all players will see this feature in their Stumble Passes, as we are currently testing this update in select regions.

This FAQ will show you how to do it effortlessly!","content":"Hey Stumblers!\n\nDo you have a favorite Stumble Guys content creator? Did you know you can support them at no extra cost to you? Just use their Creator Code in-game and show your love while you play!\n\n## What are Creator Codes?\nCreator Codes are unique codes given to our top content creators. When you enter a Creator Code in the in-game shop, a small percentage of your purchase goes directly to the creator linked to that code. So, every time you make a purchase using a Creator Code, the creator earns a portion of the sales!\n\n## How to Use a Creator Code\nTo start supporting a creator, go into the Stumble Guys in-game shop.\n![unnamed (4).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_4_50b875344b.png)\n\nHead to the Extras tab (all the way to the right of the shop).\n![unnamed (5).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_5_473092905d.png)\n\nYou should see the \"Support A Creator\" section, where you can simply click the \"Enter Code\" button.\n\nOnce you click on the “Enter Code” button, simply type any Creator Code that you wish to use, and click “Enter”.\n![unnamed (6).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_6_402332b361.png)\nYou should then see a popup confirming that you are now using that Creator Code.\n![unnamed (7).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_7_c85759b78e.png)\nCreator Codes have a time limit for how long they remain active in the shop. Some creators' codes are valid for 14 days, while others last for 7 days.\n\nRemember to keep heading back to your in-game shop to re-enter a Creator Code after it expires!\n\nIf at any point you wish to use another Creator Code, simply press the “Stop” button.\n![unnamed (8).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_8_78d87a630f.png)\nPress “Yes” to confirm and you will see that the Creator Code is removed from your shop.\n![unnamed (9).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/unnamed_9_73ea783afd.png)\nYou can now press “Enter Code” again to use another Creator Code.\n\n## What Platforms Support Creator Codes?\nCreator Codes are available across all platforms! You can enter them on Mobile, Steam, Web, and Console. Once you've applied a Creator Code on any of these platforms, any purchases made on our webstore using the same in-game name will also count towards the creator. This ensures the creator earns a small percentage of those sales too!\n\n## List of All Creator Codes\nHere’s a list of all the active Creator Codes you can start using today to support your favorite

This update brings new levels, exciting features, balance changes, a brand-new splash screen, and much more!. \nWhether you're racing through a new Block Dash experience, mastering the new Ability, or climbing the Ranked ladder, there’s something for every Stumbler. Dive in and explore everything this patch has to offer!\n\n_______\n\n#### **NEW LEVELS**\n<u>Block Dash Rush</u>\n\nWelcome to Block Dash Rush, the latest addition to the Block Dash family! This race map takes elements from the classic Block Dash elimination level and combines them with elements from Laser Dash (such as moving blocks, breakable platforms, and deadly lasers, etc.) to make a thrilling experience! \n\nFans of Block Dash can now experience the chaos of dodging obstacles, but with a racing twist—where speed and precision are the keys to victory.\n\nSet high above a neon-lit cyberpunk cityscape, Block Dash Rush reuses iconic obstacles from both Block Dash and Laser Dash—like moving blocks, breakable platforms, and lasers—creating an intense race to the finish line.\n\nThe difficulty starts off manageable, but escalates with every stretch, combining multiple challenges that will push players to their limits. Do you have what it takes to out-dash your competitors and claim bragging rights as the fastest Block Dasher?\n\n<u>Stumble Up 2</u>\n\nAre you ready to ascend once again? Introducing Stumble Up 2, the next installment of the beloved Stumble Up high-rise challenge!\n\nIn this sequel, the very fabric of Space-Time has been torn apart, unleashing complete chaos across the course. With new obstacles and surprises, it stays true to the vertical, fast-paced action that Stumblers all around the world have come to love.\n\nSet in a vibrant, sci-fi-inspired environment, Stumble Up 2 is a race through a gravity-defying world. The course features floating platforms, suspended structures, and stunning intergalactic backdrops filled with neon lights and futuristic elements. From towering spires to floating spaceports, every section of this level feels like a leap into the unknown.\n\nYou'll need to navigate across floating beams, jumping from one gravity-defying structure to another, all while maintaining balance on shifting platforms. With a host of tricky pathways, this race will challenge even the most seasoned Stumblers.\n\nDo you have what it takes to make it to the top?\n\n#### **NEW ABILITY**\n<u>Speed Gel</u>\nIntroducing the Speed Gel and its handy portable deployer! Whether you're in a rush to secure victory or helping out some sluggish teammates, this Ability is perfect for boosting movement speed and causing mayhem along the way.\n\nGameplay:\n- The Speed Gel allows players to coat the ground in a slick, fast-acting speed gel, creating accelerated paths through levels.\n- Beyond simple speed boosts, the gel can be used strategically to trap opponents or create challenging routes.\n- Encourage tactical teamwork by laying down gel to help teammates catch up, or combine Abilities for blistering speed bursts.\n\nVisual Variants\n- Extinguisher: A fire safety twist with a gel-spraying extinguisher.\n- Fire Hose: Bring the force of a high-pressure hose to propel you across the map.\n- Crocodile: Unleash your inner reptile with this fun, chompy gel deployer.\n- Tooth Paste: Squeeze out a fresh, minty clean path with this toothy variant.\n\n\n#### **NEW FEATURES**\n<u>Workshop Levels in Events </u>\n\nOur beloved Architect recently stepped up and had a serious conversation with the development team: “We’ve realized that the creativity of our players is simply too impressive to ignore” - he said. \n\nAs a result, we’re excited to announce that Player-Created Maps from the Stumble Workshop will now be featured in official Events!\n\nThe Architect made it clear: Your creations are top-notch, and it's time they take center stage! Whether it’s daring obstacle courses, tricky traps, or ingenious Race Levels, any Map from the Workshop could be selected to feature in upcoming Events.\n\nTo kick things off, we’ll be showcasing some of the most iconic and played maps from the Workshop. But there’s no set criteria—if it’s fun, creative, and exciting, it could make the cut!\n\nSo, get building, Stumblers! You just might find your level playing a starring role in the next big Event.\nNew Feature \n\n<u>Changes to the Stumble Pass</u>\n\nThe Stumble Pass has received a fresh set of updates to improve player experience and offer even more exciting rewards. Here’s what’s new:\n\n- **Bonus Page**\nOnce all the standard rewards are claimed, players will unlock an extra bonus page where they can continue spending Stumble Pass Tokens on high-value rewards. This page remains locked until all prior rewards are collected, adding an extra layer of excitement for completionists!\n\n- **Redesigned Activation Screen**\nThe activation screen has been revamped for clarity, now featuring a more distinct design that clearly differentiates between the two activation methods.\n\n- **Stumble Pass Special**\nPlayers who don’t have enough gems can now choose between two convenient options—either buy gems via offers in the store or directly purchase the Stumble Pass Special right from the activation pop-up.\n\n- **Standout Blocked Premium Rewards**\nWe’ve improved the visibility of blocked premium rewards by removing the shadow effect. This makes it easier to distinguish blocked rewards from those inside a level-locked group.\n\n- **Reward Type Indicators **\nThanks to the new reward type indicators added to the cards, similar to those used in the Stumble Journey, players can now easily identify the type of each reward at a glance.\n\n<u>Changes to the Ranked Mode</u>\n\nThe Ranked Mode continues to evolve, delivering a more competitive and streamlined experience for Stumblers aiming for the top. This update brings two important improvements to make the Ranking System clearer and more rewarding:\n- **Champion Rank Banner Update**\nPlayers in the Champion Rank will now see their Ranked Points (RP) displayed directly on the Champion Rank banner in the main Ranked screen, giving top-tier players immediate insight into their RP progress, helping them track their standing more easily.\n- **RP Reward Ceremony Fix**\nWe’ve fixed an issue with the RP reward ceremony bar, where the bar would sometimes dip lower than expected when players received negative RP. Now, the ceremony will display the correct values, offering a smoother and more accurate representation of your RP gains or losses after each match.\n\nThese changes aim to refine the Ranked experience, ensuring that both the progression and feedback systems are more intuitive for players climbing the competitive ladder.\n\n<u>Team Race Levels</u>\n\nIt’s time to gear up for another wave of Team Race Maps! This is the third batch, and we're bringing even more thrilling race maps into the team competition:\n- Cannonball Chaos Teams\n- Construction Climb Teams\n- Abducted Avenue Teams\n- Ice Caramba Teams\n- Floor Flip Teams\n- Stumble Trouble Teams\n- Humble Stumble Teams\n- Tornado Temple Teams\n- Super Paint Slide Teams\n- Super Lava Slide Teams\n- Super Waterpark Teams\n- Stumble Rumble Teams\n\nWe’ve gone over this a few times, but in case you missed it, here’s how it works:\n- For team-based race levels, there are no respawning orbs. Instead, your team’s qualification is determined by your collective team position in the race. The quicker your team finishes, the better your chances of advancing to the next round!\n- **Points System**: Every position in the game earns your team points.\n- **How to Qualify**: Your team needs to collect enough points to be in the top half. To move on to the next round, your team must be better than at least half of the teams competing.\n- **Leaderboard Changes**: As players finish, points are added to teams' totals, which can change your team's rank in real-time.\n- **End of Round**: The game round ends when there aren’t enough points left for any team below the cutoff to catch up. This means once it’s impossible for other teams to qualify, the round automatically stops.\n\n#### **BALANCE CHANGES**\nThis update brings key adjustments to two popular Abilities: Power Jump and Invisibility. These changes aim to enhance the strategic depth and fairness of gameplay, ensuring that Abilities feel both rewarding and balanced.\n\n**Power Jump**\nThe Power Jump Ability has seen a significant tweak. Previously, landing from a Power Jump would reset the jump cooldown, allowing for back-to-back jumps in quick succession. With this update, that side effect has been removed. \nNow, when you land from a Power Jump, the jump cooldown will remain in effect as normal, preventing rapid chaining of jumps.\n\n**Invisibility**\nThe Invisibility Ability now functions a little differently. While being invisible still grants a sneaky advantage, using another Ability while invisible will immediately break your invisibility. This ensures that players can no longer chain Abilities while remaining undetected.\n\n#### **COSMETICS**\n<u>Emotes</u>\n- Dreamcatcher\n- Good Night!\n- Guess I'll Die\n- Hypnotised\n- Welcome to Candyland!\n- Zzzz...\n\n<u>Footsteps</u>\n- Asleep\n- Dream Energy\n- Glowing Forest\n- Lollipops\n- Path of Dreams\n- Purple Fire\n\n<u>Stumblers</u>\n- Diesel Jack\n- Sweet Sue\n- Candybot\n- Candice\n- Caelion\n- Comet\n- Lone Skull\n- Zephyr\n- Dream Dragon\n- Luminara\n- Paco the Dreamcaller\n- Florian\n- Lucido\n- Candyland Bouncer\n- Kyra\n- Ryko\n- Flux\n- Roxy\n- Satyr Fern\n- Shroom\n- Sleepy Mr. Stumble\n- Sweetmaw\n- King of Extinction\n- Rex Skellington\n- Dream Guide\n\n<u>Taunt Animations</u>\n- Ba Dum Tss\n- Hypnotic\n- Invisible Box\n- Steel Baseball Bat\n\n<u>Victory Animations</u>\n- Big W\n- Enchanted\n- Heel Click\n- Sleepy Dance\n- The End is Here!\n\n#### **BUG FIXES**\n<u>Gameplay</u>\n- Ability Hit Box Issue: Fixed an issue where an Ability hit box could appear in two places simultaneously after being pushed by a block upon hitting the ground.\n- Invisibility Ability: Corrected the invisibility issue where players failed to become invisible when switching quickly between the Shield and Invisibility Abilities.\n- Rake Ability Range: Fixed a bug where the Rake Ability was affecting players outside the intended range.\n\n<u>Levels</u>\n- Stumble & Seek – Gameplay Fixes: Addressed a bug where some seekers were getting stuck in the spawn position and unable to move during gameplay.\n- Stumble & Seek – Custom Party: Fixed a bug allowing users to select the Stumble & Seek map for the second and third rounds in a Custom Party.\n- Laser Tracer: Fixed a bug where players hit by the Lightning Bolt Ability in the Laser Tracer map were being launched unnaturally high into the air, allowing them to stand on an invisible platform due to a collision error.\n- Block Dash: Fixed a bug where players could get stuck between double blocks.\n\n<u>Events</u>\n- Leaderboard Rewards: Fixed an issue where users failed to receive leaderboard rewards from some Events.\n- Event Rewards Display: Fixed an issue where an incorrect icon was displayed on the winning screen in some Events.\n- Event Timer Display: Resolved an issue where the Event timer went missing after completing some Events.\n\n<u>Leaderboards</u>\nFriends Leaderboard: Resolved an issue where best times were not displaying for Race Maps on the Friends Leaderboard.\n\n<u>Platform & Live Issues</u>\n- Content Update Stability: Fixed multiple issues related to full content updates being non-viable on iOS and Steam.\n- Workshop Controller Fixes: Fixed an issue with controller buttons ‘O’ and ‘X’ failing to function correctly on the 'Exit' pop-up in the Workshop when playing on Steam or PlayStation.\n- Shop – IAP Offer: Addressed a problem where players could purchase a one-time offer multiple times.\n- The minimum version required to play live has been bumped to 0.75.5.

As we anticipate the release of Transformers One, this update offers fans a chance to experience the world of Autobots and Decepticons in a whole new way!\n\n## **IP Collaboration**\n<u>Transformers One</u>\n\nThe **Transformers** frenzy started in the 80s with a line of transforming toy robots. Since then, it has expanded into a vast multimedia franchise, including animated TV series, comic books, video games, and live-action films.\n\n- **Toys:** The original line featured robots that could transform into vehicles, animals, and other objects. Popular characters include Optimus Prime and Megatron.\n- **TV Series:** The first animated series, \"The Transformers\" (1984-1987), introduced the ongoing battle between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons on Earth.\n- **Comics:** Starting also in the 80s, there have been various publishers over the years interested in this franchise.\n- **Movies:** It all started with the animated movie  \"The Transformers: The Movie\" (1986), which became a cult classic. Later, the live-action film series brought the franchise to a new generation, featuring cutting-edge CGI and large-scale action sequences.\n- **Themes and Impact:** The Transformers franchise explores themes of heroism and war among others, appealing to both children and adults. It has become a significant cultural phenomenon, influencing various media and generating a dedicated fan base worldwide.\n\nThe collaboration on Stumble Guys is focused on the upcoming movie Transformers One (release September 20th).\n\n## **New Level**\n\n<u>Stumble Rumble</u>\n\nA new take on elimination - introducing brawling!\nTake part in this chaotic PVP experience in a dynamic arena that crumbles over time!  Arm yourself with weapons and knock your enemies out! \nBut beware! You are also everyone else’s target! Watch out for those 3 precious lives, because when you run out you'll be eliminated from the round!\n\n<u>Weapons</u>\n\n- **Boxing Glove** - The faithful punch and default ability. Great for hitting \na bunch of times, but less impactful than the other weapons.\n\n- **Baseball Bat** - A more precise large hit, which can send enemies high \ninto the sky. The cooldown is a little longer on this one though, \nso make your hit count!\n\n- **Hammer Spin** - Spin into a frenzy with the ability to knock multiple \nenemies at a time. This weapon will require some skill to use, as \npredicting enemy movements will be your goal here. Just watch out, \nand don't fall from the arena as you spin!\n\n- **Golden Glove** - This weapon is meant for eliminating. The presence of the \ngolden glove strikes fear into opponents, with its high powered hit and \ncharge. However, it is up to the wielder to remain cautious while using.\n\n## **New Map Modes**\n\n<u>Rush Hour Endless</u>\n\nGet ready to dive into the exhilarating world of Rush Hour Endless! This revamped level now features a unique endless mechanic, keeping the action going as long as players remain alive. Here's more detail about this new feature:\n\n**Endless Mode**\n- The level continues until the last player is eliminated. \n- Test your endurance and see how long you can navigate the chaotic streets of Rush Hour in this never-ending challenge.\n\n**Time Trial Feature**\n- We've replaced the traditional timer with a \nmore precise Leaderboard Timer, adding a new \nlayer of competition. \n- Aim for personal bests and challenge \nyour friends to beat your survival time.\n\n**Dynamic Skybox**\n- Experience the passage of time with a new dynamic skybox that evolves as you play. \n- Watch the sky transition from dawn to dusk, adding a visually immersive element to your endless run.\n\n**Enhanced Visuals**\n- The cars and buildings have been meticulously remodeled with higher quality models. \n- Enjoy a smoother and more visually stunning experience as you race through the city.\n(Note: These enhancements have been applied to all Rush Hour maps.) \n\nJump into Rush Hour Endless and push your limits in this continuous battle for survival!\n\n<u>The Other Side Teams</u>\n\nYes, you heard it right! We've done it again! NOW INTRODUCING THE OTHER SIDE TEAMS!\n\nRally your friends and get ready for the ultimate showdown! Form teams in Events and Pairs in Custom Parties, and prepare to face off against other groups in a high-stakes battle for the crown!\n\nBut the excitement doesn’t end when a teammate is knocked out—use the newly introduced orbs to bring them back into the game and keep the battle raging! \n\nWe know you are pretty familiar with the drill by now, but just in case:\n\n- A maximum of two (2) respawn orbs will spawn randomly on the map.\n- Each orb appears at a random location and a random time, with up to 12 seconds between spawns.\n- Collecting an orb will revive players in the exact order they were eliminated, ensuring they return in sequence.\n- Even if all your teammates are still in play, you can collect orbs to make survival tougher for rival teams!\nNote: On the regular version of The Other Side, each player begins the level with 5 lives. In the team version there are no lives, only respawn orbs!\n\n<u>Additional Team Race Levels</u>\n\nIn this update, we're rolling out additional Race Levels in the Teams version. Get ready to dive into the action on these newly added tracks:\n\n- Over & Under \n- Paint Splash \n- Jungle Roll \n- Lava Rush \n- Stumble Cove \n- Abduction Avenue \n- Crab's Landing \n- Super Pivot Slide \n- Space Race \n\n\nAs usual, for the race Levels there are no respawing orbs. Instead, qualification will be based on team position in the race. Here is a brief explanation of the qualification rules:\n\n- **Point System:** Every position in the game earns your team points.\n- **How to Qualify:** Your team needs to collect enough points to be in the top half. To move on to the next round, your team must be better than at least half of the teams competing.\n- **Leaderboard Changes:** As players finish, points are added to teams' totals, which can change your team's rank in real-time. \n- **End of Round:** The game round ends when there aren’t enough points left for any team below the cutoff to catch up. This means that when it’s impossible for other teams to qualify, the round automatically ends.\n\n## **New Ability**\n\n<u>Sticky Bomb</u>\n\nIntroducing the Sticky Bomb Ability! You can guess it by its name:  a bomb that sticks to everything; walls, floors, obstacles and opponents!\n\nFrom the moment it's thrown, its timer starts and when it goes off anyone in the proximity is in a sticky situation.\n\nWhen the bomb explodes, it covers the surrounding area in sticky goo that reduces speed and jump height.\n\nWhen fully upgraded, the bomb becomes sentient and starts homing in on anyone who gets too close!\n\nHow will you use the Sticky Bomb? Cover shortcuts in sticky goo, turn opponents into walking bombs, or position explosives on popular routes to add extra risk. The possibilities are endless!\n\nWe can't wait to see the creative strategies you develop to outwit your opponents and secure victory!\n\n## **New Feature**\n\n<u>Stumble Pass Enhancements</u>\n\nWe're excited to announce a new feature in the Stumble Pass that makes progressing even more rewarding! \n\nIntroducing the \"Skip Levels\" button, a convenient option that allows you to instantly advance through the Stumble Pass by purchasing entire Levels. \n\nThis feature is perfect for those looking to unlock exclusive rewards faster or catch up on missed progress.\n\nWith just a click, you can boost your Stumble Pass journey and claim those sought-after rewards without the grind. Whether you're short on time or simply eager to unlock everything the Stumble Pass has to offer, this new option gives you the flexibility to enjoy the game your way!\n\n## **Stumble Workshop Updates**\n\n<u>New Placeables</u> \n\nWe're excited to introduce 18 brand-new placeables to the Stumble Workshop, giving you more tools to unleash your creativity. These additions include a variety of obstacles, decorative elements, and interactive objects that will elevate your custom Maps to the next Level. Whether you're designing a challenging course or crafting a visually stunning environment, these new placeables provide endless possibilities for innovation.\n\nWith this update, you'll have more control over the look and feel of your Maps. Experiment with different combinations, create unique gameplay scenarios, and share your creations with the community. We can't wait to see the amazing Maps you'll build with these new assets!\n\nAlso, a new template to play with called High-Rise is going to be available. It is a representation from our team of ways to show off the new placeables! You can edit it to make it look more like your own style, or anything else you want!\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: The new content for the Stumble Workshop (the new placeables and the new template) will be available in the game at a later time (version 0.77.5).**\n\n\n## **Cosmetics**\n\n<u>Emotes</u>\n- We Can Do It!

This isn’t your ordinary game of hide and seek—it's packed with twists, turns, and tons of fun!\n\nIn this exciting map, players split into two teams: Hiders and Seekers. But here's the catch—Hiders don’t just hide; they become part of the environment! Transform into everyday construction site objects like barrels, signs, or even tools to blend in with your surroundings. The goal? Outwit the Seekers and avoid getting caught!\n\nBut don’t get too comfy in your disguise—every 45 seconds, Hiders face a forced transformation with a dramatic smoke explosion that could give away your position! You’ll need to stay on your toes, switching between props and finding new hiding spots to keep the Seekers guessing.\n\nSeekers, on the other hand, need to keep their eyes peeled for any unusual activity. Look out for clues like unexpected smoke signals that reveal where those sneaky Hiders are hiding.\n\nSo, get ready to jump in, disguise yourself, and seek your way to victory! 3...2...1...let the games begin!","slug":"stumble-and-seek","createdAt":"2024-08-14T16:30:30.227Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-14T16:30:33.727Z","publishedAt":"2024-08-14T16:30:33.721Z","locale":"en","embedded_url":null,"main_image":{"data":{"id":883,"attributes":{"name":"seek.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":2927,"height":1647,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/large_seek_33d347c9d4.png","hash":"large_seek_33d347c9d4","mime":"image/png","name":"large_seek.png","path":null,"size":1014.19,"width":1000,"height":563},"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/small_seek_33d347c9d4.png","hash":"small_seek_33d347c9d4","mime":"image/png","name":"small_seek.png","path":null,"size":281.28,"width":500,"height":281},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/medium_seek_33d347c9d4.png","hash":"medium_seek_33d347c9d4","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_seek.png","path":null,"size":582.91,"width":750,"height":422},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/thumbnail_seek_33d347c9d4.png","hash":"thumbnail_seek_33d347c9d4","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_seek.png","path":null,"size":80.58,"width":245,"height":138}},"hash":"seek_33d347c9d4","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":1333.8,"url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/seek_33d347c9d4.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2024-08-14T16:27:23.811Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-14T16:27:23.811Z"}}},"likes":{"data":{"id":143,"attributes":{"count":8,"createdAt":"2025-04-01T05:36:41.058Z","updatedAt":"2025-07-15T15:08:35.300Z"}}},"localizations":{"data":[]}}},{"id":220,"attributes":{"title":"Split Screen is Now Available on PlayStation!","overview":"Split Screen Mode has officially landed on PlayStation.

However I have been full time as a YouTuber for two years now and stumble guys has helped me achieve that dream.\n\n**•\tWhat is your biggest accomplishment in Stumble Guys as a player?**\n    \nMy biggest accomplishment as a stumble guys player was crossing the 1000 crowns mark. But I would not consider myself that good at the game I am more focused on the entertainment and production of videos for my YouTube channel. I feel more accomplished when I create an idea start to finish and see my visions come to life. Seeing instant positive feedback keeps me to further push my limits every day. \n\n**•\tWhat do you like the most about Stumble Guys?**\n    \nMy favorite thing about stumble guys is the accessibility of it. The fact that it's on every platform allows anyone in the world with a device to join in on what I create. I think my strong suit is being able to rally my community to create unique ideas. And stumble guys complements that extremely well. There's no other game on the market that allows you to have 32 players in the same game from anywhere in the world from any device and it's free. Not to mention stumble guys gets updates weekly and having direct developer support as a content creator makes my life so much easier.\n\n**•\tWhat is your favourite skin/emote/etc?**\n    \nBefore my brand-new bundle got released my favorite skin was the golden sensei. I like how clean yet flashy it makes you feel and it pays homage to the OG days of this game. My favorite ability is punch closely followed up by the brick ability. My favorite footsteps is the Mach 10 which actually my bundle has a new and improved golden version which is now my favorite lol.\n\n\t**•\tWhat is a good memory you have from Stumble Guys in your life?**\n    \nI have so many good memories of being a content creator for stumble guys. The first one that comes to mind was being the 1st official North American English content creator for the game. But that has been surpassed as my favorite memory with me now receiving the 1st custom creator bundle in stumble guys. Seeing myself in a video game next to characters like SpongeBob Mr. Beast and Pac-Man is unreal.\n\n**•\tDo you have advice you want to give to new players?**\n    \nMy biggest advice for new stumble guys players is to just play for fun and overtime you will get the hang of it. The game is not that complicated and so the more you enjoy it the more you'll get better at it. However if you do not have any abilities I would prioritize getting punch, kick, volleyball, and invisibility.\n\n**•\tFavourite IP introduced into the game?**\n    \nMy favorite IP in stumble guys has to be SpongeBob. Not only are there so many of my favorite characters from the show in the game, but there are also three unique collab maps, and abilities to go along with it.\n\n**•\tCan you share what initially drew you to create content specifically for Stumble Guys?**\n    \nWhat initially drew me to make content for stumble guys was the fact that I could play alongside my twitch chat. At the time I had about 50 people live watching me and 32 of them could all join in beside me. This combined with the virality of the game on TikTok really showed me what the potential of being a creator for this game could be.\n\n**•\tWhat does your content creation process look like for Stumble Guys? How do you plan and execute your ideas?**\n    \nMy content creation process is all about consistency. It's easy to get caught up in the numbers of it all, but I am more focused on output. So every day I post a main channel video and a second channel video with sometimes also a short being posted. Which means I need to have a lot of ideas and so if I think of something I typically just do it. And based off the performance, replicate what works. So, in the morning I will write down my agenda on what I will film, then in the afternoon I will execute the ideas and at night I create my thumbnails and do it all again the next day. It's definitely not easy to create as much as I do but I have had seven different jobs in my life and I would pick this over a 9-5 job any day of the week.\n\n**•\tCould you describe one or two of your favorite pieces of content that you’ve made for Stumble Guys and what made them special?**\n    \nMy first favorite piece of content I've made for stumble guys is when I 1v1ed 100 players. The reason this is my favorite is it took so long to create with 6 hours of recording and the fact that I won 66 and only lost 34 out of those 100. The second video that comes to mind is when I had the opportunity to play against Ludwig and his streaming friends in stumble guys for $20,000. Me and my team absolutely destroyed his and won the challenge. Also, Ludwig was a large reason I created content in the first place, so it was a win win.\n\n**•\tWhat are your future plans regarding content creation for Stumble Guys? Are there any new directions or concepts you’re excited to explore?**\n    \nIf I'm being honest, I don't have any crazy future plans, I'm just going to continue what I'm already doing and continue to push myself.\n\n**•\tWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to start creating content for Stumble Guys?**\n    \nMy biggest advice for new content creators for stumble guys is to just try it. It's easy to think I want to be a content creator, but it takes a lot of consistency and repetition, so everyone will suck when they first start. I have posted over 2400 videos in just 4 years. I had no idea how to video edit or create thumbnails when I started but if you do something enough every single day you will become better than most. Everyone thinks you need a nice camera and setup to be successful but the game is on your phone and anyone these days can be a content creator. The other key element is to make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. I did not think I would be where I'm at today and I started making content purely for fun. And so if you can have fun while making content and do it every day I think that's how you become a successful stumble guy's content creator.\n\n**•\tWhy did you pick these items for your curated bundle?**\n    \nWhen I first got told I would receive a stumble guys bundle I didn't know where to start. But I decided to take elements of my main stumble guy skins that I've used in the past and formed it into the BabyYoda_TV skin. For the base model I wanted my skin to look like me. In every single one of my YouTube videos I wear a black shirt and my necklace that I bought when I hit 100,000 Subs on YouTube. So it worked out perfectly that I used the golden gloves skins chain. Next I was thinking about what shoes I would wear, not a lot of people know this but I am very into sneakers and so I wanted my shoes to match my chain with gold accents. As I mentioned before my favorite skin was the gold sensei so I wanted swords on my back just like that skin. The final touch was the sunglasses which match my skin perfectly. For the emote in my bundle I needed my cat George to also be in stumble guys so this was a perfect spot for him. And finally my footsteps are a golden version of the Mach 10 which is my favorite footsteps.\n\n**•\tWhere is the bundle available and for how long?**\n    \nMy bundle is available in the in game shop or on the stumble guys website from August 5th to the 11th.\n\n**•\tWhat is your creator code?**\n    \nMy creator code is BabyYoda and you can use it in the shop to support me\n\n\n**•\tThe link to your main channel**\n\nYou can find my channel [_**[HERE]**_](https://www.youtube.com/@BabyYodaTV)\n\n![WEB OFFER_Baby Yoda CC Bundle 2.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/WEB_OFFER_Baby_Yoda_CC_Bundle_2_3dcdae2bad.png)\n![WEB OFFER_Baby Yoda CC Bundle 1.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/WEB_OFFER_Baby_Yoda_CC_Bundle_1_6a1ee06fa4.png)","slug":"babyyodaTVs-skin","createdAt":"2024-08-05T14:34:04.403Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T16:00:00.093Z","publishedAt":"2024-08-05T16:00:00.000Z","locale":"en","embedded_url":null,"main_image":{"data":{"id":875,"attributes":{"name":"babyyoda_skin_v2.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/large_babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0.png","hash":"large_babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0","mime":"image/png","name":"large_babyyoda_skin_v2.png","path":null,"size":491.18,"width":1000,"height":563},"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/small_babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0.png","hash":"small_babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0","mime":"image/png","name":"small_babyyoda_skin_v2.png","path":null,"size":151.79,"width":500,"height":281},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/medium_babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0.png","hash":"medium_babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_babyyoda_skin_v2.png","path":null,"size":300.57,"width":750,"height":422},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/thumbnail_babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0.png","hash":"thumbnail_babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_babyyoda_skin_v2.png","path":null,"size":48.78,"width":245,"height":138}},"hash":"babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":372.15,"url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/babyyoda_skin_v2_2ce1f7cae0.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2024-08-05T14:40:33.423Z","updatedAt":"2024-08-05T14:40:33.423Z"}}},"likes":{"data":{"id":46,"attributes":{"count":3128,"createdAt":"2025-03-05T22:44:34.658Z","updatedAt":"2025-09-15T16:20:39.776Z"}}},"localizations":{"data":[]}}},{"id":218,"attributes":{"title":"New Ranked Season and Ability Balance Changes","overview":"We've made balance adjustments in our latest update to our Abilities like Karate Chop, Hug, Shield and more!","content":"**NEW ABILITY BALANCE CHANGES**\n\n**Karate chop**\n- The radius will be widened slightly to make it easier to hit players.\n\n**Hug**\n- We will be reducing the duration of the hug time to make it easier to break out of a hug.\n- Additionally we have enabled the ability to break a hug through the use of other abilities.\n\n**Shield**\n- We will be reducing the force that the shield ability repels other players at higher levels.\n\n**Invisibility**\n- We will be adjusting the duration of the ability as well as its cooldown.\n\n**Punch**\n- We have heard and seen the feedback on the power of punch and will be reducing the force of the knock back as well as the upwards force at max level.\n\n**Power jump**\n- Max height reduced slightly across all tiers.\n\n**Magnetism**\n- Abilities that have a magnetism ability will have the force of the magnetism reduced as they get into higher levels.\n\n**Cooldowns**\n- We have looked at the frequency that abilities are being triggered and are looking to reduce this slightly as such we will be adjusting the cooldown of abilities, particularly at higher levels.\n__________________\n\n_Have you started the New Rank Season yet?

Are there any new directions or concepts you’re excited to explore?**\n- I am really looking forward to the clan feature, because before it could be said that the clan community in stumble guys was very large, but with no official features from the stumble guys game it made clan lovers, especially competitive in the clan field, reduced.\n\n**What advice would you give to someone who wants to start creating content for Stumble Guys?**\n- My advice to new Content Creators are to stay consistent, just a few options you can hone your skills and become number 1 or you have very good editing skills and combine with montage stumble guys.\n\n**Why did you pick these items for your curated bundle?**\n- A lot of people have asked me to bring back the brazilian flag footstep and boxing skin.\n\n**Where is the bundle available and for how long?**\n- In game shop and it will be from 25 July until 28 July\n\n**What is your creator code?**\n- My creator code is SAHRUL\n\nYou can find my Channel [_<u>[HERE]</u>_]( https://www.youtube.com/@SahrulRajuan)\n\n![WEB OFFER_SahrulRajuan CC Bundle.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/WEB_OFFER_Sahrul_Rajuan_CC_Bundle_7f29fdfec3.png)","slug":"CCbundle-sahrulrajuan","createdAt":"2024-07-25T12:05:19.135Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-27T12:00:00.023Z","publishedAt":"2024-07-27T12:00:00.000Z","locale":"en","embedded_url":null,"main_image":{"data":{"id":846,"attributes":{"name":"sahul_web_thumb.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/large_sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d.png","hash":"large_sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d","mime":"image/png","name":"large_sahul_web_thumb.png","path":null,"size":544.14,"width":1000,"height":563},"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/small_sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d.png","hash":"small_sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d","mime":"image/png","name":"small_sahul_web_thumb.png","path":null,"size":174.95,"width":500,"height":281},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/medium_sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d.png","hash":"medium_sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_sahul_web_thumb.png","path":null,"size":337.35,"width":750,"height":422},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/thumbnail_sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d.png","hash":"thumbnail_sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_sahul_web_thumb.png","path":null,"size":56.37,"width":245,"height":138}},"hash":"sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":394.69,"url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/sahul_web_thumb_ccbf10681d.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2024-07-25T12:04:01.246Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-25T12:04:01.246Z"}}},"likes":{"data":{"id":49,"attributes":{"count":260,"createdAt":"2025-03-06T04:31:20.951Z","updatedAt":"2025-08-01T23:32:27.613Z"}}},"localizations":{"data":[]}}},{"id":213,"attributes":{"title":"Patch Notes 0.76 - My Hero Academia is Here!","overview":"Stumble Guys welcomes My Hero Academia!

It's all about a world where almost everyone has superpowers, or \"Quirks.”\nThe story centers around a young guy named Izuku Midoriya (AKA Deku), who's part of the unlucky few born without a Quirk. But this kid's got a big dream—to become a hero just like his idol, All Might, who's the number one hero and symbol of peace.\nThe series is a fantastic mix of intense battles, heartfelt moments, and a deep dive into what it really means to be a hero. \n\n## NEW COLLAB MAP + QUIRKS\n<u>Hero Exam</u>\nPrepare to prove your prowess and secure a spot at the prestigious Hero Academy. As you enter the bustling mock city of Ground Beta, you’ll select from one of five unique Quirks, each offering distinct advantages. The race is on to navigate the city’s hazards, battle rogue robots, and make your way to the towering giant robot menacing the skyline.\nThe Hero Exam Level features a difficulty that scales with your mastery of Quirks. Utilize your skills wisely and embark on your journey to become a hero. Navigate the perils, harness your powers, and rise above the competition at the Hero Exam!\n\n<u>Quirks</u>\nSome of the Quirks grant you with both a Passive buff and an Active skill. They are activated with the same button and will apply both effects on your Stumbler simultaneously. The Active skill will only take effect if the conditions are met (there are other stumblers in the area of effect, or there is a wall in the range of the quirk, etc).\n\n\n**One for All**\n- Passive buffs: Higher jump and faster run speed\n- Active skill: Shockwave punch\n\n**Explosion**\n- Active skill: Explosion jump (up to 3 charges over time)\n\n**Half Cold**\n- Active skill: Ice ramp (up to 2 charges over time)\n\n**Frog Form**\n- Passive buffs: Higher jump\n- Active skill: Tongue grapple\n\n**Gigantification**\n- Passive buffs: Larger size, higher jump, slower acceleration, \n- faster speed, stumble resistance\n- Active skill: Flying kick\n\n## NEW ORIGINAL MAP\n<u>Stumble & Seek</u>\nDive into a thrilling game of hide and seek in the world of Stumble Guys.

Hiders disguise themselves as everyday objects within the construction site, blending seamlessly into their surroundings to evade capture.\nAs a Hider, transform into various props like barrels, signs, or tools, and switch between forms to outsmart Seekers. Beware, you'll need to change shape periodically, which could blow your cover!\nKeep your eyes peeled for clues like unexpected smoke signals that reveal the Hiders' positions.\nEvery 45 seconds, Hiders face a forced transformation, marked by a dramatic smoke explosion, adding a layer of challenge to their stealth tactics.\nGet ready to blend, disguise, and seek your way to victory in the Stumble & Seek Map.

To move on to the next round, your team must be better than at least half of the teams competing.\n- **Leaderboard Changes:** As players finish, points are added to teams' totals, which can change your team's rank in real-time. \n- **End of Round:** The game round ends when there aren’t enough points left for any team below the cutoff to catch up.

Chris, our Design Director who worked on the feature, is back with answers to clarify any doubts you might have! Let's go!","content":"Happy Friday Stumblers,\n\nWe’ve heard your many questions about Abilities, and we’re here to help! Chris, our Design Director who worked on the feature, is back with answers to clarify any doubts you might have! Let's go!\n\n\n**- Are abilities here to stay? How long will the ability update last?**\n- Yes abilities are here to stay.  We are closely monitoring the performance of abilities, how they are used, and how they interact in the game at different progression stages and will be doing regular balance updates for both specific abilities behaviours as well as globally in their use.\nAdditionally, we will be adding new abilities in the future.  The goal is to allow more people to gain abilities and to have each ability feel like it has an area it excels at so that people want to collect more and use different ones in different types of game modes and levels.\n\n**- Will you balance / nerf the abilities? Will you do this before adding new abilities?**\n- Right now we are monitoring the initial launch and we are focused on updating the balance of abilities.  We will continue to do this in all future seasons.\nWe are also looking at adding new abilities to introduce new play opportunities and will be launching them when they are ready.\n\n**- How are you approaching the balance of new abilities? Is it data driven only or will community feedback be considered?**\n- We take a multi-source approach to balancing of abilities.  We look at the data from the game as to which abilities people use and upgrade, also we run various simulations in our internal tool to help balance an ability.  Additionally we are always looking at the community feedback and factoring that in as part of our overall balance approach.\n\n**- What will you do to keep the Abilities and Ranked Meta fresh & fun?**\n- This is a twofold answer. First, for ranked, we will be looking at updating map pools and changing up rewards each season to keep the experience fresh. Second, we are looking at additional changes, such as format structures.\nFor abilities we will continually look at the balance of abilities as well as introduce new abilities which have specific purposes in the game to help keep the meta fresh.\n\n**- Will you bring back how taunts used to work on spikes in Block dash? If no, can you do the same exact thing with an Ability?**\n- We do not plan to bring back the momentum cancel effect from taunts as we found that this was being used as an exploit to avoid a game challenge rather than helping players develop skill.  To compensate from this we have added this property to specific abilities (and may add to others) so now you need to have the ability, upgrade it and time your action to avoid the obstacle and not just mash a single button.\n\n\n**- Why are specific abilities only available in the Shop for purchase?**\n- Some abilities will be initially only launched in the shop, these abilities are available for those who want to get them as an early access. Over time shop abilities will be rotated into the main pool and become available to unlock with Ability Keys.\n\n\n**- Will all new stumble passes no longer have a \"Special Emote\" as before?**\n- The current plan is to not add any abilities directly into the stumble pass instead we have replaced this with Ability keys as this acts as a primary source for the keys for everyone allowing them to unlock the ability they want (and save up)\n\n\n**- Will console get abilities?**\n- Console is currently several versions behind mobile, they will get abilities at some point.\n\n\n**- How do I earn more Ability Keys & Tokens?**\n- Ability keys can be earned by completing the Battle Pass.  If you complete the Battle Pass each season you will get ability keys and can either spend them immediately or save up for a higher rarity Ability.\nAbility tokens come from the Battle Pass but also will appear as rewards in Ranked, Daily wheel and other sources.  By returning regularly and playing all areas of the game you can maximize your ability to get more Ability Tokens\n\n**- Will there ever be a Ranked mode that has abilities disabled?**\n- This is something that is under discussion, for now we want to see how things play out as the new system has just launched and many players are still getting and upgrading their Abilities.  We will be monitoring the use and behaviour in ranked and this will factor into both our balance and long term decisions.\n\n\n**- Will you add a \"try it before you buy it\" feature for abilities?**\n- Great suggestion, this is not something we have currently on our roadmap but can look into it\n\n\n**- The most disliked effect is Magnetism. Will you nerf or remove it?**\n- We are looking at this right now and we will be rebalancing it to some extent.  Whether it is removed entirely is not decided as yet.\n\n\n**- Can you add the option to hide the Emote/Taunts UI button completely?**\n- If you mean can we hide the Icon on the side of the screen this is something we can look at adding to settings.\n\n\n**- Can you add the option to choose your current ability level if it is maxed? Some abilities like Punch are worse off when maxed out because the knockback is too strong and you cannot body push the opponent.**\n- This is not something we are looking at doing rather this sort of feedback we will take into account as part of our balancing.\n\n\n**- Will you be able to downgrade an ability if you no longer want it maxed?**\n- For now we are not working on this, as the feature evolves and we get more data from players we may look at introducing a method to reset the progression.\n\n\n**- Will there be a way to reset abilities and receive some Keys / Tokens back?**\n- Per previous comment this is not something we are planning right now but is something we are open to looking into in the future once we have more data and have seen the feature evolve. Most likely it will just be a progression reset and not an unlock reset as we do want to make sure unlocking an ability is something people do tactically\n\n**- Will there be any more updates regarding abilities?**\n- Yes we will be continually updating abilities both the balance of existing and adding new ones.\n\n**- Can we use weaker versions of ability’s in customs?**\n- Right now this is not something we have planned to support\n\n\nWe hope this clarifies the new abilities and features! Please continue to share your feedback so we can keep improving.\n\nThank you, and have a great day!\n","slug":"abilitiesAMA","createdAt":"2024-07-19T14:48:43.942Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-19T14:49:53.831Z","publishedAt":"2024-07-19T14:49:48.720Z","locale":"en","embedded_url":null,"main_image":{"data":{"id":834,"attributes":{"name":"AbilitiesAMA.png","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"large":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/large_Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843.png","hash":"large_Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843","mime":"image/png","name":"large_AbilitiesAMA.png","path":null,"size":966.08,"width":1000,"height":563},"small":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/small_Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843.png","hash":"small_Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843","mime":"image/png","name":"small_AbilitiesAMA.png","path":null,"size":271.68,"width":500,"height":281},"medium":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/medium_Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843.png","hash":"medium_Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843","mime":"image/png","name":"medium_AbilitiesAMA.png","path":null,"size":568.05,"width":750,"height":422},"thumbnail":{"ext":".png","url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/thumbnail_Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843.png","hash":"thumbnail_Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843","mime":"image/png","name":"thumbnail_AbilitiesAMA.png","path":null,"size":78.81,"width":245,"height":138}},"hash":"Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":493.34,"url":"https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/Abilities_AMA_4d28eda843.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3-advanced","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2024-07-19T14:47:15.026Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-19T14:47:15.026Z"}}},"likes":{"data":{"id":83,"attributes":{"count":100,"createdAt":"2025-03-09T19:43:35.256Z","updatedAt":"2025-08-27T09:41:03.507Z"}}},"localizations":{"data":[]}}},{"id":211,"attributes":{"title":"Non-stop fun!

Learn about rank progression, rewards, matchmaking, and the new Abilities system that will elevate your gameplay.","content":"Hey Stumblers! Exciting news – our very first Ranked season, \"Season Zero\", is here! This season brings a brand-new Ranked Mode and awesome new Abilities to explore. Want to know how to climb the ranks and unlock cool rewards? Let’s dive in and discover everything you need to know to become a Stumble Guys pro!\n\n# RANKED\n<u>Progressing Through Ranks</u>\n\nProgressing through the ranks is all about earning Rank Points (RP) through your performance in ranked matches. Here's a breakdown of how you can climb the ranks:\n\n- **Position**: Your placement at the end of each match significantly impacts your RP. Higher positions yield more points, while lower positions–especially in higher ranks–may result in point  deductions.\n\n- **Rank Structure**: Each rank consists of three tiers (I, II, III), starting from Wood and advancing through Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Master, and Champion. You earn RP by playing ranked matches, and each rank has specific thresholds for promotion.\n\n- **Season Reset**: At the end of each ranked season all players' ranks are reset to the initial rank, Wood I. This guarantees that every new season starts on an even playing field, allowing all players to compete with a fresh start.\n\n- **Season Boost**: Returning players from previous seasons get a Season Boost multiplier, which is based on your performance in the last season,  helping you climb back to your previous rank more quickly. The boost only applies until you reach your previous season’s rank.\n\nFor example, if in your previous season you attained Gold rank, when the season resets you will have an X boost multiplier that increases the RP you are awarded at match end until you reach the Gold rank again. \nNotes: \n- Season boost multiplier does not take effect when your position results in negative RPs\n- Season boost multiplier stops as soon as you enter your previous season rank\n\n![2024-06-21_16h41_13.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/2024_06_21_16h41_13_16756558d6.png)\n\n<u>Leaderboards</u>\nThe leaderboard is global, allowing you to see where you stand against the best players around the world. It displays up to 1,000 of the top players, along with your global ranking. For players that reach the Champion rank, their position will be displayed in the Ranked lobby as well as the Rewards screen.\n\n<u>Rewards</u>\nEach Rank is divided into three tiers. Climbing up tier grants you rewards as shown in the graphic to the right. Rewards include: Stars, XP, and the new currency Ability Tokens. You will need this new currency to upgrade all new Abilities. More on that soon!\n\n**Seasonal Changes**: Each new season brings exciting new opportunities for new kinds of rewards and amounts!This means that the specific rewards and amounts you can earn may change from one season to the next, keeping the competition fresh and exciting.\n![image (1) (1).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/image_1_1_6980ea7e38.png)\n\n<u>Matchmaking </u>\nMatchmaking isn’t just based on Rank, Rank Points matter too. Players with a similar amount of Rank Points will be matched with each other, prioritizing and balancing for the players’ levels and of course, matchmaking time.\n\nRanked Matches are 1 round of 16 players, with a defined set of elimination maps in **Season Zero**, our first Ranked season. \n\n<u>Additional information</u>\n**No rank demotion**: Once promoted to a rank, players cannot be demoted during the season. While players can move up and down the tiers within a rank, their RP will never drop below the minimum required for the highest rank they have achieved. This means that once you reach a new rank, you are secured at that level for the entire season, even if you lose matches.\n\n**First Rank**: All players will remain unranked until they play their first ranked match. After this match, they are placed in Wood I and can start progressing through the ranks. After the season ends all ranks are reset to Wood I.\n\n**Rank info in your profile:**  We have included a few new sections into the Player’s Profile screen, which indicate additional information related to Ranked:\n- Current Season Rank: Current Rank Tier\n- Best Season Rank: The highest Rank you've earned in any season (updated at the end of each season)\n- Rank History: Displays the accumulation of your highest earned rank from every past season (updated at the end of each season) \n\n![Profile Ranked.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/Profile_Ranked_e71e65b9c9.png)\n\n# ABILITIES\nTraditional Special Emotes have been transformed into Abilities! Just like Special Emotes, players can equip Abilities and use them during matches.\n\nNormal Emotes and Taunts can now be equipped separately, so you can have four Emotes/Taunts and four abilities equipped at any given time.\n\nAs before, Abilities add a strategic layer to the gameplay, allowing players to choose skills that complement their playstyle in a specific map or experience and give them an edge in the competition.\n\n<u>Unlocking and Progression</u>\n\nAbilities are now unlocked with a dedicated currency called **Ability Keys**, which you can find in Stumble Journey, as well as Stumble Pass.\n\nThis means players will now have the freedom to collect Ability Keys with the goal of unlocking their preferred Ability.\n\nAdditionally, we have introduced a new progression that allows players to enhance their favorite Abilities. This progression enables you to reduce cooldown Time, increase the area of effect, boost impact force, and improve various other stats and characteristics associated with each Ability.\n\nIn order to upgrade your Abilities, you will need to collect the other new currency, **Ability Tokens**. This currency can be found throughout the game in Stumble Missions, Lucky Wheels, Stumble Pass, Stumble Journey, the Shop and from Ranked progression rewards.\n\n![how to get currency (1).png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/how_to_get_currency_1_ccadbd1867.png)\n\nEach Ability can be upgraded through 15 levels of enhancement. As you progress through these levels, your Abilities become more powerful and effective. This will give you a greater edge in matches!\n\nEach time you level up one of your Abilities, you have the opportunity to improve one of its characteristics. You have full control over how you want your game to evolve!\n\n<u>Additional Bonus Effects</u>\n\nSome Abilities have an additional Bonus Effect when upgraded to the maximum level.\n\nCheck out the following table for more details:\n\n![abilities.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/abilities_8e4e131f6b.png)\n\n<u>Ability Styles</u>\nWhen upgrading your Abilities to levels 5, 10, and 15, the upgrade grants you an extra visual style. Once unlocked, you are free to choose and equip the one you want to use. You have full customization!\n\n![2024-06-28_12h23_07.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/2024_06_28_12h23_07_8daf6aeac2.png)\n\n<u>Ability Gameplay</u>\n\nAbilities now have their own dedicated buttons–separate from emotes–which also have four customizable buttons. This allows you to use four Abilities and four Emotes simultaneously, giving you more power and versatility in matches. You can now enhance your gameplay with powerful Abilities, while still expressing yourself with Emotes.\n\n![Monosnap 0.75 Patch Notes - Google Docs 2024-07-02 10-23-10.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/Monosnap_0_75_Patch_Notes_Google_Docs_2024_07_02_10_23_10_ea0fdeb988.png)\n\n<u>Special Emote Compatibility</u>\n\nWondering what will happen to your Special Emotes? Don’t worry, you won't lose them! Your Special Emotes will automatically convert to their corresponding Abilities, pre-upgraded to match the power level of the original Special Emote. From there, you can continue upgrading these Abilities at your own pace.\n\nWe have also combined several Special Emotes–which previously were just visual variations (like Fire Punch, Wet Kick, Golden Banana, etc.)-into a single Ability. If you already own any of these, you'll unlock the Ability with its progress maintained and gain access to the updated style variations without needing to unlock them again.\n\n**Changes to Taunts and Abilities**\n\nWe have disabled the use of Taunts to restrict movement. This exploit allowed players to bypass Level mechanics, creating an unfair advantage in some Levels.\n\nInstead, we have integrated this behavior into specific new Abilities, such as the Shield, which players can unlock and use in a more controlled way. This, and other mechanics, are now a part of the Ability system.\n\nSo, Stumblers, are you ready to take on Season Zero and make your mark on the global leaderboard? With new ranks to achieve, rewards to earn, and abilities to master, there's never been a better time to jump into the fray. Share your thoughts and strategies with us, and let's make this inaugural season unforgettable.

This, and other mechanics, are now a part of the Ability system.\n\n**New Gameplay Feature**\n\n<u>Laser Tracer Endless</u>\n\nYou asked for it, and we delivered! Welcome to the thrilling world of Laser Tracer Endless! This revamped Llevel introduces a unique endless mechanic, meaning the challenge continues as long as players remain alive. Here's what you can expect from this exciting update:\n\nEndless Survival: The Llevel doesn't stop until the last player is eliminated. Test your endurance and see how long you can outlast your opponents in this never-ending laser dodging frenzy.\nSurvival Timer: A new timer tracks how long you can survive, adding an extra layer of competition. Aim for personal bests and challenge your friends to beat your survival time.\nDynamic Skybox: Experience the passage of time with a new dynamic skybox that changes as you play. Watch the sky evolve from dawn to dusk, adding a visually immersive element to your endless run.\nRemodeled Map: The Laser Tracer Mmap has been meticulously remodeled for a smoother and more enjoyable experience. Navigate the arena with improved aesthetics and fluidity.\n\nDive into Laser Tracer Endless and push your limits in this continuous battle for survival!\n![lacer tracer.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/lacer_tracer_7620a7d152.png)\n\n**New Gameplay Feature**\n\n<u>Bot Bash Teams</u>\n\nWe know how much our community loves team Maps, so we’re bringing you more! Get ready for Bot Bash Teams, where teamwork and strategy are key.\n\nGather your friends for an epic showdown! Form teams in Events and Custom Parties, and go head-to-head with other groups in a fierce battle for the crown. If a teammate gets knocked out, no worries! Use the new orbs to revive them and keep the momentum going strong.\n\nBy now, you’re probably familiar with the Teams feature, but here’s a quick refresher just in case you missed the previous updates:\n\n- A maximum of two (2) respawn orbs will appear on the Map.\n- Each respawn orb appears in a random place of the Map\n- Each respawn happens in a random amount of time after the last one was collected with a maximum of 12 seconds.\n- Collecting orbs will bring back players in the same order they have been eliminated, so they always come back in the same order they were eliminated (first out - first in)\n- You can collect orbs even if all your teammates are alive in order to make it more difficult for your rival teams to survive.\n![bot bash teams.png](https://live-assets.web.stumbleguys.com/cms/bot_bash_teams_9cfbb06048.png)\n\n<u>Cosmetics </u>\n- Stumblers\n- Firewing\n- Warpwing\n- Cyberturion\n- Emperor Maximus\n- Rayder\n- Bionic Blaze\n- Origami \n- Napoleon Bonaparte\n- Musketeer Pierre\n- Fisherman Tom\n- Foxy\n- Dixie\n- Momo\n- Wendy\n- Stumblin' Rhymez\n- Quantum Velocity\n\n<u>Footsteps</u>\n- Fireflies\n- Garbage\n- Volcanoes\n- Warp Speed\n\n<u>Emotes</u>\n- Golden Metal \n- Ave!\n- Fishing Pole \n\n<u>Taunt Animations</u>\n- Ready, Set, Go! \n- Advance \n- Fencing \n\n**Bug fixes**\n\n- Resolved a visual error in the Stumble Pass Level-Up screen which displayed Levels beyond the intended limit.\n- Resolved an issue allowing players to move while using the Cartoon Fall Taunt during gameplay, maintaining intended gameplay mechanics.\n- We have disabled the use of taunts to cancel movement.

Watch out for the fragile wooden planks that can be obliterated by these explosions, adding an extra layer of strategy to your run. To top it off, a tricky water current will periodically sweep through, pushing players to the left and right in an alternating pattern.\n\nBut the fun doesn’t stop there! The infamous Flying Dutchman himself is at the helm, ready to challenge you with an array of quirky and perilous obstacles. Encounter the mystifying **Closed Chest**, which nudges players, and its towering counterpart, the **Open Chest**, which requires skillful jumps to navigate. The **Rotating Barrel** is another obstacle designed to push players around, while the menacing **Explosive Barrel** detonates on contact, obliterating the floor beneath.
